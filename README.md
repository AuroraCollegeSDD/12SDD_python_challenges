# PythonChallenges

A series of python challenges you can work through when your teacher is away.

If you feel like you want to consolidate the basics choose exercises from [Practice Python](https://www.practicepython.org)

If you are feeling more confident, try exercises from the following list:

* [Python conditional statements and loops](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-conditional-statements-and-loop-exercises.php)
* [Python functions](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-functions-exercises.php)
* [Python class](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/class-exercises/index.php)

As you complete a task, add your solution to a branch of this repository as a python file and add the task and date to the table below. One of your challenges is to add tasks to the table using markdown. Use this [markdown-cheetsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)

At the end of the lesson, create a pull request and tell me what work you have completed.
